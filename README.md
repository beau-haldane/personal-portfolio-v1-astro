# Beau Jorgensen - Software Developer Portfolio

## Overview
- Designed in Figma
- Built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), styled with plain ol' CSS (plus a bit of javascript for the navigation)
- Inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)'s portfolio

## Project Goals
- Keep the UI and UX as simple as possible while still looking and feeling modern
- Utilise basic CSS to avoid reliance on styling frameworks
- Clearly present my skills and experience
