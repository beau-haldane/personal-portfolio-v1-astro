    It was the year 2001 when I got my first taste of web development. My older
    brother patiently taught me to create my very first index.html file which
    simply read, “Hello World!” and I was hooked.

    In 2022, after years of building websites for bands and completing freelance
    projects, I took the steps to becoming a professional software developer.
    I’ve now had the privilege of designing and coding websites for diverse
    clientele, writing software for <a

      Australia’s largest telehealth provider
    </a>, as well as an <a href="https://cadent.au/" target="_blank">
      ethical software consultancy
    </a>. My journey has been marked by a passion for innovation,
    problem-solving, and a desire to expand my skillset.

  <p>
    When I’m not coding, you'll find me playing gigs with my band, working on
    one of many creative projects, or enjoying some yoga.
