    It was the year 2001 when I got my first taste of web development. My older brother patiently taught be to create my
    very first index.html file which simply read, “Hello World!” and I was hooked.

    Over 20 years later I’ve now had the privilege of designing and coding websites for diverse clientele, writing
    software for <a href='https://www.coviu.com' target="_blank">
      Australia’s largest telehealth provider
    </a>, as well as an <a href='https://cadent.au/' target="_blank">
      ethical software consultancy
      </a>. My journey has been marked by a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and a desire to expand my skillset.

    When I’m not coding, you'll find me <strong>playing gigs with my band</strong>, working on one of many <strong
      >creative projects</strong
    >, or enjoying some <strong>yoga</strong>.
